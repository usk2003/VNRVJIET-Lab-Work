Configuring FTP Server for File Sharing

1. Understand FTP
•	FTP Server: A computer that hosts files and allows users to upload or download them.
•	FTP Clients: Applications used to connect to the server (e.g., FileZilla, WinSCP).
•	Protocol: FTP can operate in plain text or securely using FTPS (SSL/TLS) or SFTP (SSH-based).

2. Prerequisites
•	Server Machine: A dedicated computer or virtual machine to act as the FTP server.
•	FTP Software: Examples include:
o	Windows: IIS (Internet Information Services) or FileZilla Server.
o	Linux: vsftpd, proftpd, or pure-ftpd.
•	Network Configuration: Ensure the server has a static IP or domain name.

3. Install and Configure FTP Server
On Windows (Using FileZilla Server):
1.	Download and Install FileZilla Server:
o	Download FileZilla Server.
2.	Configure Server:
o	Launch FileZilla Server Interface.
o	Set the host (IP address), port (default: 21), and admin password.
3.	Create Users and Directories:
o	Go to Edit > Users.
o	Add a new user, set a password, and assign a directory.
4.	Enable Firewall Rules:
o	Open Control Panel > System and Security > Windows Defender Firewall.
o	Add an inbound rule to allow traffic on port 21.

4. Secure the FTP Server
•	Use FTPS or SFTP:
o	Enable SSL/TLS for secure connections (FTPS).
o	Alternatively, use SFTP if SSH is available.
•	Limit Access:
o	Restrict FTP users to specific directories.
o	Disable anonymous access.
•	Enable Strong Passwords:
o	Require users to set strong passwords.

5. Connect to the FTP Server
•	Using an FTP Client (e.g., FileZilla):
1.	Open FileZilla Client.
2.	Enter the server’s IP address, username, password, and port (default: 21).
3.	Connect to start transferring files.

6. Test the Server
•	Test uploading and downloading files.
•	Verify permissions to ensure users can only access their designated directories.

We cover the following topics:\n","\n","1. **Supervised Learning - Classification**: This involves training a model to classify data into distinct categories. We use the Iris dataset and apply the Random Forest Classifier to predict the species of flowers based on various features.\n","\n","2. **Supervised Learning - Regression**: Regression tasks involve predicting a continuous value. We use the California housing dataset and apply the Random Forest Regressor to predict housing prices based on various features like location, number of rooms, and more.\n","\n","3. **Unsupervised Learning - Clustering**: Clustering is a type of unsupervised learning where the goal is to group similar data points. We use K-Means clustering on the Iris dataset and evaluate the clustering performance using Silhouette Score and Adjusted Rand Index.\n","\n","The following code blocks demonstrate how to apply these algorithms using Python's scikit-learn library, followed by model evaluation metrics.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"ZgIAspQqhvDL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#**1.

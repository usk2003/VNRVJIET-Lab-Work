1. Print hello world
echo "Hello World"

2. Addition of two numbers
echo -n "Enter number 1: "
read NUM1

echo "The sum is $SUM"

3. Biggest of two numbers
NUM1=5
NUM2=12
if [ $NUM1 -gt $NUM2 ]
then
  echo "NUM1 > NUM2"
else
  echo "NUM2 > NUM1"
fi

4. To check whether the given number is positive or not
echo -n "Enter a number: "
read NUM
if [ $NUM -gt 0 ]
then
  echo "$NUM is +ve"
elif [ $NUM -lt 0 ]
then
  echo "$NUM is -ve"
else
  echo "$NUM is 0"
fi
echo "done"

5. Write a shell program to check whether the given character is a vowel or not
echo -n "Enter a character: "
read CHAR
case $CHAR in
  a|A) echo "You entered $CHAR which is a vowel" ;;
  e|E) echo "You entered $CHAR which is a vowel" ;;
  i|I) echo "You entered $CHAR which is a vowel" ;;
  o|O) echo "You entered $CHAR which is a vowel" ;;
  u|U) echo "You entered $CHAR which is a vowel" ;;
  *) echo "You entered $CHAR which is not a vowel" ;;
esac

6. Case statement example
echo -n "Oceans are larger than lakes (True or False): "
read USER_INPUT
case $USER_INPUT in
  "TRUE" | "True" | "true") echo "Yes, you are right" ;;
  "FALSE" | "False" | "false") echo "No, you are wrong" ;;

esac

7. String comparison
STR1="Mani"
STR2="sha"
if [ "${STR1}" = "${STR2}" ]
then
  echo "Strings match"
else
  echo "Strings don't match"
fi

8. Logical operators
echo -n "Enter a NUM: "
read NUM
# Check whether a number is between 10 and 20 (Using AND -a operator)
if [ $NUM -ge 10 -a $NUM -le 20 ]
then
  echo "$NUM is between 10 and 20"
else
  echo "$NUM is NOT between 10 and 20"
fi

echo -n "Enter another NUM: "
read NUM
# Check whether a number is between 10 and 20 (Using OR -o operator)
if [ $NUM -lt 10 -o $NUM -gt 20 ]
then
  echo "$NUM is NOT between 10 and 20"
else
  echo "$NUM is between 10 and 20"
fi

9. While loop
COUNT=0
while [ $COUNT -lt 5 ]
do
  echo "Loop count is $COUNT"
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
done
echo "Done"

10. While loop example
echo -n "Enter a number: "
read NUM
SUM=0
I=1
while [ $I -le $NUM ]
do
  SUM=$((SUM + I))
  I=$((I + 1))
done
echo "The sum of the first $NUM numbers is: $SUM"

11. For loop
COUNT=0
for ((i = 0; i < 5; i++))
do
  COUNT=$((COUNT + 1))
  echo "Loop count is $COUNT"
done
echo "Done"

12. Functions
# Function definition
function print_hello() {
  echo "========="
  echo "==hello=="
  echo "========="
}

# Call the function
print_hello

13. A script to show the usage of functions and how to pass arguments
# Function definition
function find_sum() {
  SUM=$(($1 + $2))
  echo "The sum is $SUM"
}

# Pass arguments 10 and 20 to find_sum function
find_sum 10 20

14. A script to show how to declare an array and access its elements
# Declare an array
FRUITS=(apple mango banana orange)

# Print value of each element
echo "element 0: ${FRUITS[0]}"
echo "element 1: ${FRUITS[1]}"
echo "element 2: ${FRUITS[2]}"
echo "element 3: ${FRUITS[3]}"

# Print size / length of array
echo "Length: ${#FRUITS[@]}"
echo "Whole array: ${FRUITS[@]}"
echo "Whole array: ${FRUITS[*]}"

# Looping over array elements
echo "Looping over array elements"
for ITEM in ${FRUITS[@]}
do
  echo "$ITEM"
done

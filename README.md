# Lab Work Repository - VNR VJIET (R22 CSE-AIML)

Welcome to the repository where I store all my lab work performed during my B.Tech (CSE-AIML) course under the R22 regulation at VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology (VNRVJIET), regulated by JNTU-Hyderabad.

This repository includes various labs from different subjects in the curriculum, showcasing my practical learning, implementation of algorithms, and solutions to different problems.
